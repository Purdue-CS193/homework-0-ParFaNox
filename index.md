## Welcome to Anshuman's First CS193 Homework

I used the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for my website in Markdown files.

Whenever I commited to this repository, GitHub Pages ran [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content my Markdown files.

### Markdowns?

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
